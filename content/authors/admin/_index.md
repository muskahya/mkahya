## About Me

I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU) in 2017. In 2021, I earned my M.Sc. in Informatics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). During my Master's studies, I joined the TUM Computer Vision Group, where I conducted research on 3D Reconstruction and Multi-view Shape from Shading for my thesis. After gaining a year of industry experience, I commenced my Ph.D. at the Chair of Media Technology in June 2022. My current research focuses on out-of-distribution and anomaly detection for short-range FMCW radars.
